# Platformer-game

This a simple 3D game I made in OpenGL. You can download the .rar archive to try it out directly or compile the Visual Studio project.
I used [this](https://github.com/davidwparker/opengl-screencasts-2) tutorial code to get started with an OpenGL environment.

## Instructions
* You can move with w-a-s-d, if you press the right mouse button you can rotate the camera (you don't have to keep it pressed), if you press left mouse button then you fixate the camera. 
* Jump with space.
* The aim of the game is to jump as many times as you can, always landing on the platform, while one of the w-a-s-d keys is constantly pressed down (so you have to constantly move).
* There are ten levels, the movement speed is increased at each level.
* In the left corner you can see your score and the level.
* If you land outside the platform or you stop moving you lose all points and your position is reset to the starting position.
